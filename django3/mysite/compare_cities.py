# City Comparison

'''
This file produces a list of tuples comparing the relative quality between
different cuisine types in a pair of cities.

Usage: Call compare_cuisines with two cities of interest, as well as paths to
the database used and the list of valid cuisine tags. Filtering by price is
also possible

Example call: compare_cities('chicago', 'new york', database = "yelp_raw.db", 
cuisines = "cuisines_tags.csv", results = 5)

    '''
    Compare the cuisines in two cities, creating a Pandas dataframe containing
    the relative strength of each city's cuisine, ranked. Also produces graphs
    displaying outlier information.

    Inputs:
        - city1: String of first city of interest
